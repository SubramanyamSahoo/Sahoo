## Some Flagship Projects on Legal AI

### Analyzed and quantified social bias exhibited by BERT and word2vec models, particularly focusing on bias in large language models (LLMs).
### Identified patterns in prompt distributions, providing insights into how different prompts influence model outputs.
### Assessed the model's exposure to biased legal documents in the context of Legal AI, specifically analyzing the impact on Google's Gemma-2 9 Billion model.
### Developed a metric to compare bias between the LLMs
